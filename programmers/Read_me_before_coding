Welcome to my web development repository! This collection of files is designed to help you quickly set up a basic website structure. It includes three versions of each file - HTML, CSS, and a combination HTML/CSS file. Simply choose the file type you prefer and start customizing the content and styling to match your needs. The HTML files provide a clean, semantic markup structure, while the CSS files allow you to easily change colors, fonts, and layouts. For a more streamlined approach, the combined HTML/CSS files merge the markup and styling into a single file. Feel free to use these files as a starting point for your next web project. Happy coding!
